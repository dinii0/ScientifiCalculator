## <h2 align=center>*What is this Password Vault?* </h2>
Password vault is an application coded in C++, which helps users to store certain passwords, codes, or anything personal into a more secured area.

## <h2 align=center>*How does this work?* </h2>
The app has a simple encrypting/decrypting system which hides the passcodes into a file. The file will be saved in the same directory where the executable file is.

## <h2 align=center>*How can I add passwords?* </h2>
There is a button written *'Add Item'*, when you press this a window will pop up. There you will have two fields:
+ Name
   - Short info regarding what this passcode is about.
+ Passcode
   - The actual passcode.
   
## <h2 align=center>*How can I remove passwords?* </h2>
Simple, select the passcode you wish to discard, right click it, and click *'Remove Item'*

## <h2 align=center>*Installation* </h2>
The code I provided is not full. So therefor I recommend manually to add the files to an existing project of yours. The main source code is *'PasswordVault.cpp'*. I also provided the *.ico* file and the *.rc*

## <h2 align=center>*Some informations regarding to the application* </h2>
- You can store as many passcodes as you want, there are no limit and it's expected to work efficiently.
- Encryption is **NOT** 100% qualitative, so therefor It can be cracked if someone sits and analizes them for a **VERY** long time, otherwise it can't be crackable immediately, unless they look at the *'WordCryption.h'* file.
- The name/passcode can be saved to your clipboard if you double click the item.
- I won't be updating this application sooner or later, unless there's a huge bug or a glitch that kills the proccess of working efficiently
- This project was tested on this system:
   + Windows 11
   + 64 bit
   + 32 GB RAM
   + Intel Proccesor
   + NVIDIA Graphics Card

... with that being said, I'm expecting one some operative system to not work or to be buggy. Especially old operating system with outdated motherboard, CPU etc.

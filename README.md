## <h2 align=center>*What is this Calculator about?* </h2>
This calculator helps users to calculate different equations, the calculator gives you opportunity to work with matrices, GCM, sigma function, pi, sin, tan, cos etc.

## <h2 align=center>*Files and their structure* </h2>

## <h2 align=center>*There are 3 windows, what are those about??* </h2>
  + Number table
       - Here the app shows the equation you wrote as an input, and if there is a result it will be painted on the bottom of the window.
  + Warning table
       - Everytime you input something that is mathematical/logical incorrect, the window warns you by outputing the error and emiting a warning sound
  + Temporary save
       - If you want to save an equation later while calculating, you can press the button top-right, and it will be saved till u close the application.

## <h2 align=center>*What is the button next to the 'Save' one?* </h2>
I implemented a dark/light mode feature. You can change the color scheme of the application everytime you press it.

## <h2 align=center>*Installation* </h2>
The code I provided is not full. So therefor I recommend manually to add the files to an existing project of yours. The main source code is *'PasswordVault.cpp'*. I also provided the *.ico* file and the *.rc*

## <h2 align=center>*Some informations regarding to the application* </h2>
- You can store as many passcodes as you want, there are no limit and it's expected to work efficiently.
- Encryption is **NOT** 100% qualitative, so therefor It can be cracked if someone sits and analizes them for a **VERY** long time, otherwise it can't be crackable immediately, unless they look at the *'WordCryption.h'* file.
- The name/passcode can be saved to your clipboard if you double click the item.
- I won't be updating this application sooner or later, unless there's a huge bug or a glitch that kills the proccess of working efficiently
- This project was tested on this system:
   + Windows 11
   + 64 bit
   + 32 GB RAM
   + Intel Proccesor
   + NVIDIA Graphics Card

... with that being said, I'm expecting on some operative system to not work or to be buggy. Especially old operating system with outdated drivers.
